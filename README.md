## Overview

We study the privacy risks of LLM-based recommender systems under the in-context learning paradigm by evaluating multiple **membership inference attack strategies**. The attacks probe whether a user–item interaction has appeared in the training data of the underlying model.

The implemented attacks include:
1. **Inquiry-based Attack**
2. **Similarity-based Attack**
3. **Memorization-based Attack**
4. **Poisoning-based Attack**

The framework is model-agnostic and operates purely through black-box API access.

## Supported Language Models

All LLMs are accessed **via the Ollama API**, ensuring reproducibility without distributing proprietary or large model weights.

The following models are supported:

- **LLaMA3-8B**
- **LLaMA4-Scout**
- **Mistral-7B**
- **Gemma3:4B**
- **GPT-OSS (20B)**
- **GPT-OSS (120B)**

Model selection is controlled through command-line arguments.

> **Note:** No model weights are included in this repository.

## Dataset

Due to storage capacity limitations, we only provide the **MovieLens** dataset in this repository.

- MovieLens is sufficient to reproduce all main experimental results reported in the paper.
- The data are preprocessed into an ICL-compatible recommendation format.

The codebase is designed to support additional datasets, which can be plugged in following the same interface.

## Experimental Scope

Our evaluation spans a total of **200 experimental configurations**, obtained by varying:
- the target LLM (6 models),
- the number of in-context demonstrations (3 shot settings),
- the position of poisoned examples in the prompt (5 positions), and
- the poisoning attack strategy (3 variants).

This design enables a systematic analysis of how prompt composition and attack choices jointly affect membership inference vulnerability.

## Running an Inquiry Attack

The inquiry-based membership inference attack can be executed with the following command:

```bash
python3 inquiry.py \
  --models llama3 \
  --datasets ml1m \
  --num_seeds 100 \
  --all_shots 1 \
  --positions end
```
## Running an Similarity Attack

The inquiry-based membership inference attack can be executed with the following command:
```bash
python3 semantic.py \
  --models llama3 \
  --datasets ml1m \
  --num_seeds 100 \
  --all_shots 1 \
  --positions end
```

## Running an Memorization Attack

The memorization-based membership inference attack can be executed with the following command:
```bash
python3 repeat.py \
  --models llama3 \
  --datasets ml1m \
  --num_seeds 100 \
  --all_shots 1 \
  --positions end
```

## Running an Poisoning Attack

The poisoning-based membership inference attack can be executed with the following command:
```bash
python3 repeat.py \
  --models llama3 \
  --datasets ml1m \
  --num_seeds 100 \
  --all_shots 1 \
  --positions end \
  --poison_num 1
```
